# Examples for rigid image registration
This repo is for hosting examples of how to perform rigid image registration of exapnsion microscopy volumes. To install the toolbox please see `../README.md`.

The first notebook gives an overview of the library, and the most simple way to perform registration. 

The second notebook goes a bit deeper and discusses how modifications to the parameter map SITK uses can change your results (for better or for worse)

The third and final notebook goes into several solutions for problems that one may encounter when using this library. Each solution and problem is not mutually exclusive, but some are more general than others, and the notebook discusses that.
